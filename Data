Since we have already looked at New York and Torontoâ€™s neighborhood data, I will continue my project on comparing these two cities and decide where I want to open a new restaurant at.
Besides all the datasets provided in the lab, I will bring in more datasets of population and capita of each neighborhood for the city. I might take tax and house price into affect as well depending on how complex the data is.
