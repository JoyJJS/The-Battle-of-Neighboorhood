One of the most common business problems that can effect the success of a business is location. Such as why Walmart stores are next to highways or why restaurants are close to one another. There is a reason why businesses spend a great deal of time and resources doing market research on which location to choose.
Some of the factors that influence location is the business type and the targeted customer group along with each businessâ€™s own purpose. Should the business be close to school, close to a highway, away from a highway, close to a hospital, etc.
